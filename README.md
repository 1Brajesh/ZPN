This is a twine project with sugarcube.
It's an interactive self help book to allow anyone to heal themselves from chronic pain.
This book is not for everyone and while you read it, you can filter yourself out if the healing does not apply to you.

It's intention is to be free to the world so those that are truly committed to healing can follow the steps and heal themselves.

My wish is for a pain free world.
